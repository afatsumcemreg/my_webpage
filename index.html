						<p>
							Hello! Welcome to my webpage. My name is Mustafa Germec and I am 32 years old. I am from Turkey. I got the title of 
							Food Engineer from the Akdeniz University, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Food Engineering in 2012, and after 
							my BSc graduation, I have completed my education of Master's in 2014 and Doctorate in 2019 at the same department. 
							Between April 2013 and December 2013, I have worked as a Food Engineer in the food sector. Followed by, I have 
							worked as a Research Assistant at the Akdeniz University, Department of Food Engineering in 2013-2017. After 
							I have lost my job at the university, I have worked as a Food Engineer in a Catering Company in Sakarya, Turkey 
							from September 2018-March 2019. I am married and have a Son. Now, I am living in Luzern, Switzerland with my family. 
							On this webpage, you will find more information about me. This webpage includes my information, contact information, 
							hobbies, languages I spoke, educations, experiences, publications including theses, SCI articles, non-SCI Articles, 
							translates, conference proceedings, certificates, projects, and some photos. 
						</p>
						<p>
							On the other hand, nowadays I am learning German, writing my scientific articles, and reviewing the scientific
							articles. Besides, I am interested in programming, data science, and web development. Therefore,  in my free time, 
							I am learning programming languages(Python and JavaScript), HTML, CSS, SQL, and data science. The purpose of my learning 
							is to integrate them with my area of expertise (production, purification, and characterization of value-added products,
							pretreatment processes of renewable resources, and statistical, kinetical, and mathematical modeling of fermentation
							processes), train myself, and find a good job in Switzerland. I hope I find a good 
							job in the direction of my targets.
